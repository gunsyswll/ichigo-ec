# Ichigo Theme — Changelog

Versioning for the **Ichigo-preview** theme (Shopify theme id 186906968344).
The live **Rise** theme is never touched. Bump with `python3 ../bump_version.py [major|minor|patch]`.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-06-24
- Fix collection page heading/breadcrumb: no longer shows the JA auto-collection
  title "商品" (now an editable heading, default "Our Strawberry Boxes" + "Shop" crumb).
- Fix "Showing 0–0 of 0 products" — use `collection.products.size` (the special "all"
  collection returns 0 for `products_count` even when products render).

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-24
- Initial versioned release.
- Static HTML → Shopify OS 2.0 Liquid theme (layout/sections/templates/config, 48 files).
- Nav pages created + wired: about / farmers / help / shop.
- Real commerce: 4 products, `/collections/all` product list, product pages with
  add-to-cart, cart → native Shopify checkout.
